# Disease-Progression-Prediction-Using-Linear-Regression-in-Python
Project Description:

This project is a continuation of the initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase. The primary objective is to implement a Linear Regression model using Python's Scikit-learn module to predict the progression of a disease, specifically diabetes, by employing least-squares regression.

Key tasks and goals of the project include:

Single Feature Prediction:

Predict the disease progression (feature 'y') using a single feature from the dataset (feature 'X').
Identify the most predictive single feature from 'X' for 'y'.
Output the model’s coefficients (slope, y-intercept), plot the Linear Regressor Model, and calculate the Mean Square Error (MSE).
Pair Feature Prediction:

Predict the disease progression using a pair of features from the dataset.
Identify the most predictive pair of features from 'X' for 'y'.
Output the model’s coefficients, plot the Linear Regressor Model, and calculate the MSE.
Multiple Feature Prediction:

Predict the disease progression using all ten features of 'X' in the dataset.
Output the model’s coefficients and calculate the MSE.
The dataset for this project is sourced from Stanford University's Machine Learning Repository. The model’s performance will be evaluated based on the coefficients and Mean Square Error (MSE) for each of the predictive tasks. The project aims to provide a clear understanding of the relationship between various features and the progression of the disease, using linear regression analysis to derive meaningful insights. All tasks and their outputs will be documented and submitted in a single Jupyter Notebook or Colab file.
